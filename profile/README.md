# HackerCat: Scratch improved
HackerCat is a mod of Scratch that adds custom extensions and features to the Scratch editor and community.
 
## Paint editor
The HackerCat mod includes heavy changes to Scratch's paint editor.

Some of the features include color swatches, dark mode, hex color picker, extra fonts, custom fonts, larger canvas bounds, round outlines, and more.

## Scope
Scope allows users to run a hosted functional copy of Scratch on a server. It can host either the HackerCat website + Scratch editor, the Scratch website + Scratch editor, or just the Scratch editor.
